Welcome to Spotify Playlist Explorer!
What this program does:
Takes a folder full of playlist CSVs, cleans them, and combines them into a single master CSV, 
while creating a couple of charts.

To get started:
1. Go to https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-exporter/
2. Convert your desired playlists into CSVs
3. Store them in your desired folder
4. Copy the path to this folder; path should look like this -> C:\Users\You\Playlists
5. Extract this zip file somewhere
6. Double-click the spotify_playlist_explorer.exe; the Command Prompt will open
7. When asked, paste the folder path into the Command Prompt
8. When it's done, there will now be an "outputs" folder next to the .exe
   You'll find:
   - master.csv - contains all songs from all the CSVs in your folder
   - artist_counts.png
   - year_counts.png
   - primary_genre_counts.png
   - parent_genre_counts.png

Notes:
- This program only runs on Windows (64-bit)
- No Python installation is needed
- If Windows SmartScreen warns you about this program, click "More info" and then "Run anyway" (trust me)
